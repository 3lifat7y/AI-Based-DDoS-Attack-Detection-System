    <h1>AI-Based DDoS Attack Detection System</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>

    <p>
        This project presents an intelligent system for detecting and classifying
        <strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</strong> attacks by analyzing
        network traffic using Machine Learning techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        DDoS attacks are among the most common and dangerous cyber threats.
        Attackers flood servers with massive numbers of requests, making services
        unavailable for legitimate users. These attacks can cause financial losses,
        system downtime, and security risks.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main idea of this project is to build a smart system that monitors network
        traffic, analyzes its behavior, and automatically distinguishes between
        normal and malicious activities. Instead of relying on traditional rule-based
        methods, the system learns patterns from real-world data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project is based on the <strong>CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset</strong>, which
        contains realistic network traffic representing both normal usage and
        different types of DDoS attacks. This helps make the system more reliable
        and practical.
    </p>

    <p>
        After preprocessing the data, a Machine Learning model is trained to recognize
        traffic patterns and classify them into normal or attack categories.
        The trained model is then integrated into a web application using
        <strong>Flask</strong>, allowing users to interact with the system easily.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this interface, users can upload data, perform predictions, and view
        classification results in a simple and user-friendly way, making the project
        applicable outside the development environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project was developed as a <strong>Level 3 academic project</strong> and
        represents an important step in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world
        cybersecurity problems. It provided hands-on experience in data processing,
        machine learning, system integration, and teamwork.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, this system aims to provide an effective, scalable, and easy-to-use
        solution for early detection of DDoS attacks and improving network security
        and response time.
