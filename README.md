# 🔐 AI-Based DDoS Attack Detection System

## 📌 Project Description
This project presents an intelligent system for detecting and classifying **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks** by analyzing network traffic using Machine Learning techniques.

DDoS attacks are one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats. In these attacks, a server or network is flooded with a massive number of requests, making services unavailable for legitimate users. This can lead to service downtime, financial losses, and serious security risks.

The goal of this project is to build a smart system that can monitor network traffic behavior and automatically distinguish between normal activity and malicious traffic. Instead of relying on traditional rule-based security methods, the system learns patterns from real-world data and uses them to make accurate decisions.

The project is based on the **CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset**, which contains realistic network traffic data representing both normal traffic and different types of DDoS attacks. This makes the system more reliable and closer to real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

After preparing the data, a Machine Learning model is trained to recognize traffic patterns and classify them into normal or attack categories. To make the system more practical, the trained model is integrated into a web application using **Flask**, allowing users to interact with the system through a simple and user-friendly interface.

Through this interface, users can upload data, perform predictions, and view classification results easily. This transforms the project from a standalone model into a complete, usable system.

This project was developed as a **Level 3 academic project** and represents an important step in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world cybersecurity problems. It provided hands-on experience in data processing, machine learning, system integration, and collaborative work.

Overall, the system aims to provide an effective, scalable, and easy-to-use solution for early detection of DDoS attacks and improving network security and response time.
